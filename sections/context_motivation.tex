\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to the nature of quantum states, verifying the output of quantum devices is an arduous process.
    \item Quantum State Tomography (QST) aims to rebuild a quantum state through measurements.
    \item We need infinite measurements (and therefore copies) of a quantum state to know it exactly. In practice we only need certain precision.
    \item The cost of achieving the same precision increases exponentially with the number of qubits. 
\end{itemize}
