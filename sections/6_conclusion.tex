%In this work we have established a conjecture that can be used to prove that a more efficient approximation of outputs of noisy shallow circuits can be achieved, with some limitations that represent future lines of work.

\frametitle{Future work}
Even though we have given some evidence that local Gibbs states can approximate noisy circuits,
\begin{itemize}
    \item more models of noise need to be studied,
    \item bigger systems need to be simulated to make the results truly significant,
    \item the exact impact of temperature in the effect of depolarizing noise on Gibbs states needs to be further studied.
\end{itemize}
